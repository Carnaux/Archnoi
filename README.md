Archnoi is software for generating archtecture based on voronoi diagrams.


## The development of this project is based on phases



| Phase 1       | % done       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Generating floor polygon      | 95% |
| Multiple floor generation | 20%      |
| Generating windows and doors     | 0%      |


| Phase 2       | % done       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Offset floor outline     | 0%     |
| Generating rooms     | 0% |

| Phase 3       | % done       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Landscape archtecture    | 0%     |
| Generating furniture    | 0% |



Long term project!
